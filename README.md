# webscraping-challenge

For this project, I completed a web-scraping and data analysis task, focusing on extracting information from the Mars news website and analyzing Mars weather data. I used tools like Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape titles and preview text from news articles, storing the data in Python dictionaries and a list. Additionally, I extracted and analyzed Mars weather data from an HTML table, answering questions about the number of months, Martian days' worth of data, and average temperature and atmospheric pressure for different months. Finally, I exported the analyzed data to a CSV file. Through this project, I refined my skills in web scraping and data analysis.
